Following are the steps to import downloaded certificate into {{SITENAME}} server:

:1. Open Command Prompt with Administrator privileges. Right click on <nowiki>cmd.ex</nowiki>e and select '''“Run as Administrator”.'''<br>
:2. Navigate to “'''&lt;&lt;OpsHub_Installation_Directory&gt;&gt;\AppData\OpsHubData'''” folder. <br>
:3. Run the following command: <br>
:: [Note: '''Default installation path for HTTPS Certificate''':  “&lt;&lt;OpsHub_Installation_Directory&gt;&gt;\AppData\OpsHubData\cacerts”]
	
::<code>keytool –importcert -alias '''''&lt;&lt;certificate alias&gt;&gt;''''' -keystore '''''&lt;&lt;path&gt;&gt;''''' -file '''''"Certificate_Location\Certificate <nowiki>filename.ex</nowiki>tension"'''''</code>

::'''''For e.g.: '''keytool -importcert -alias httpscertifcate -keystore "C:\Program Files\OpsHub\AppData\OpsHubData\cacerts" –file "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\certificate.crt".

:4. On clicking the enter button, it will ask for a password. Please provide the password.<br/>
:: ['''Note:''' Default key store password for OpsHub Integration Manager is '''‘changeit’'''].
:5. Type '''‘yes’''', when it asks for “'''Trust this certificate?”''' <br>

::'''Note''': If any hierarchy is present in the certificate, then all the certificates are required to be imported.
::'''Note''': If you have multiple certificates of end systems configured in {{SITENAME}} imported into the {{SITENAME}}'s Keystore, and these certificates have different private key passwords, you can use the Certificate Password Encryptor Utility to encrypt and store the passwords. This utility will create a cacert_config.properties file containing all the certificate alias names and their passwords in encrypted format. You can then use this file to load certificates from the Keystore in {{SITENAME}}.

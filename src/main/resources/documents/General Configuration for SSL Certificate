'''''Note: '''''Please note with the above steps OpsHub will be installed with SSL configuration. But corresponding SSL certificate imported will be self-signed. In case you want to install certificate signed by your CA authority then you are supposed to follow steps given in this [ section] after succefully installation of OpsHub.

====Import the certificate generated by Certification authority (CA)====

Following are steps that one require to perform to import the OpsHub SSL certificate which is generated by third party Certificate authority (CA).Please note following steps can be performed once OpsHub installation completed succefully with the self-signed SSL configuration.



* Stop the running OpsHub Server/Service.
* Take the back up of OpsHubData folder in  &lt;OpsHub Installation Directory&gt;/AppData/OpsHubData
* Open the command prompt with the administrative privileges & within command prompt go to the &lt;OpsHub Installation Directory&gt;/AppData/OpsHubData directory



Following are set of commands that has to be performed in the given sequence within command prompt.

Commands will respectively create a CSR & Cers certificate (which are generated by your CA) & import the certificate on the machine where OpsHub is installed.



# ''keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias <nowiki>opshub.com</nowiki> -keysize 2048 -keystore &lt;OpsHub Installation Directory&gt;\AppData\OpsHubData\cacerts ''



Upon successful execution of above command, it will prompt you to enter the password for AppData\OpsHubData\cacerts i.e. keystore <nowiki>password.so</nowiki> enter the password for the same. Default password for the keystore is changeit



Please note after the password you will be prompt for the various information about certificate details, out of which for the first name and last name value it is mandatory to provide the host name of the machine where your opshub is installed otherwise you will not able to see the signed certificate even after the succefully import of certificate.



# ''keytool -certreq -keyalg RSA -alias tomcat -file &lt;path of new CSR file&gt; -keystore &lt;OpsHub Installation Path\AppData\OpsHubData\cacerts&gt;''



Example of above command: ''Keytool -certreq -keyalg RSA -alias <nowiki>opshub.com</nowiki> -file &lt;OpsHub Installation Dir&gt;\OpsHub_Resources\jre\lib\security\<nowiki>opshub.cs</nowiki>r -keystore &lt;OpsHub Installation Dir&gt;\AppData\OpsHubData\cacerts''



After the execution of above command, you are supposed to share above CSR to your CA (certificate authority) to generate the certificate file (.cer) corresponds to it. In this case certificate file generated with the name <nowiki>opshub.ce</nowiki>r. Once certificate file generated by your CA execute the import command given in below step.







# Last command is to import certificate file in to keystore. If your certificates are in Root Certificates or Chain certificate, in such case you are supposed to first import root certificate then the actual certificate. Otherwise only import your certificate file.





Command to import the root certificate.



''keytool -importcert -alias root -keystore &lt;OpsHub Installation path&gt;\AppData\OpsHubData\cacerts  -trustcacerts -file &lt; root CER file path&gt;''



Command to import your certificate.



''keytool -import -alias <nowiki>opshub.com</nowiki> -keystore &lt;OpsHub Installation Path&gt;\AppData\OpsHubData\cacerts -file &lt;Path of your CER file&gt;''



* After succefully execution of above commands, Change <nowiki>server.xm</nowiki>l to use keyAlias="key alias given during import process" in above case keyAlias="<nowiki>opshub.com</nowiki>”. The <nowiki>server.xm</nowiki>l file located at &lt;OpsHub Installation Path&gt;\OpsHubServer\conf path.
* Finally Restart the opshub server

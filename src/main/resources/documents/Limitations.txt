= Synchornization Limitations and Known Behaviours =

== Common ==
There are a few limitations that are common across all connectors. The limitations are listed below:

* '''User Mention Synchronization Limitations''' 
** If both the source and the target system support synchronization of User mentions and the user which is being synchronized from the source system does not exist in the target system, then that user's display name as seen in the source system will synchronize to the target system as literal text.
** If the source system supports synchronization of User mentions but the target system does not, then there are two scenarios:
*** If the user ''exists in both the source and the target system'', then the target system's user's display name will synchronize to the target system as literal text.
*** If the source user ''does not exist in the target system'', then the source system's user's display name as seen in the source system will synchronize to the target system as literal text.
** In both the above-mentioned cases, once the literal text for the user's display name is synchronized to the target system, and when this data is synchronized back to the other system, the actual User mention will be overwritten with the literal text as displayed in the target system.

* '''Inline Image Synchronization Limitations'''
** The inline image from an entity of the source system synchronizes as a broken image to the target system, given that the embedded inline image URL in the source system is not accessible/reachable from the machine on which OIM is installed while the entity is getting synchronized. In that case, the inline image synchronizes to the target system without transformation in the URL corresponding to the target system. As a result, the synchronized image is broken.
** Synchronization of the height and width of the inline image is performed only for HTML-supported systems.
** If the same image is referred to more than once with a different height and width, then only the size of the last image is synchronized with all the images on the target side.

== End System Limitations ==
In addition to the common limitations, each system has its own set of synchronization limitations. Such limitations are available in limitations section on each [[ Connectors| Connector]] page.
